IMAGE BLUR
----------

Given a data representation of a pure black and white image, perform a transformation on the image data. 

Implement a blur method to run a pixel transformation on the image. Running a blur transformation causes any 1 in the image to cause the pixel to the right, left, above and below to become a 1.
